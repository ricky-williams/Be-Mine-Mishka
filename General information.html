                Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be defined as a rang of complicated conditions
                characterized by challenges with social, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal
                communication. ASD can be a small problem or a disability that needs full-time care
                in a special facility. People with autism find it hard to communicate with others.
                They also find it hard to understand what other people think and feel. This then
                makes it hard for them to express themselves, either with words, or through
                gestures, facial expressions, and touch. People with ASD might have problems with
                learning as well (Autism speak, 2020).

            <p style = "color: black" ><strong>
            It is not easy to make an ASD diagnosis, there is not lab test for it, so
            doctors have to rely on observing the behaviors of very young children as well
            as listening to their parents concerns(cdc.gov, 2020).
            
            <br>
            
            Getting an autism diagnosis is a two stage process and it starts with your pediatrician.
            
            <br>
            <h5 style = "color: black"> <u>Developmental screening</u></h5>
            Pediatricians are the first step, every child gets an assessment at their 18-24 month
            check-ups to make sure they are on track and don't have an symptoms. Pediatricians will 
            ask parents about their family history, if anyone has ASD in their family and about their
            child's behavior. The doctor will look at these milestones such as, did the baby smile by 6 months,
            did they baby mimic sounds or facial expressions by 9 months, and was the baby babbling and cooing
            by 12 months (cdc.gov, 2020). Doctors will also ask a rang of other questions which can be found 
            <a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/how-do-doctors-diagnose-autism">HERE.</a> 
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            Your responds to the questions asked are very important in your child's screening. If it checks out
            and there is no concerns then that will be the end of it. But if there is development issues and the
            doctor has concerns, they will refer you to a specialist for more tests. 
            
            <br>
            <br>
            
            if your child requires more test you next appointment will be with a team of ASD specialists child psychologist, 
            speech-language pathologist, and occupational therapist. You may also meet with a
            developmental pediatrician and a neurologist (cdc.gov, 2020).
            
            <br>
            This evaluation is usually to check things like your child’s cognitive level, language 
            abilities, and other life skills like eating, dressing themselves, and going to the bathroom.
            
            <a style="color: blueviolet">For an official diagnosis<a>, your child must meet
                    the standards of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
                    (DSM-5).
                    
            <br>
            <br>
            
            If your child shows potential symptoms of ASD, their doctor may monitor their
            development with a new device that uses data and artificial intelligence to help
            diagnose ASD.  The Cognoa ASD Diagnosis Aid is a machine learning–based software 
            that follows children between the ages of 18 months and 5 years and helps evaluate 
            and identify any developmental issues (cdc.gov, 2020).
